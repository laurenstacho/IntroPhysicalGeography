# Labs

This folder contains the materials you need to complete the labs for the term. Each file is named for the week the lab takes place (e.g. Lab 2 matches Week 2 lectures). 

FOR STUDENTS IN MY GEOS 113: If you are taking this class in person, please be sure you are printing out the labs ahead of time and completing any pre-labs there may be!
