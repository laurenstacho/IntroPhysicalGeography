# Introductory Level Physical Geography

This repository contains materials for an introductory level course in physical geography that covers topics in Earth's weather, climate, and biomes. 

I have been continuously updating this course prep and teaching this course in some iteration or modality since Fall 2007. The materials in the lectures and labs are the result of many years worth of improvement, and the efforts many Geographers around the world through their dedicated teaching. I have been inspired and advised by many people through my career and I believe these slides have benefitted as a result of such collaboration.

All of the materials in this prep are free to download and use as you see fit. I have split up the README files in each subfolder to provide more details to both students and teachers who may be using this work. 

I genuinely welcome feedback so if you find something missing, incorrect, or broken in this repository, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at lstachowiak@ewu.edu! 

Live long and prosper,
Lauren
