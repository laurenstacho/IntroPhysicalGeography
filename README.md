# Introductory Level Physical Geography

This repository contains materials for an introductory level course in physical geography that covers topics in Earth's weather, climate, and biomes. This course is taught in person and online at Eastern Washington University by a variety of instructors so each section of the course is slightly different--these are how I teach the course. These materials are of my own design and creation unless otherwise noted.

I have been continuously updating this course prep and teaching this course in some iteration or modality since Fall 2007. The materials in the lectures and labs are the result of many years worth of improvement, and the efforts many Geographers around the world through their dedicated teaching. I have been inspired and advised by many people through my career and I believe these slides have benefitted as a result of such collaboration.

All of the materials in this prep are free to download and use as you see fit. I have split up the README files in each subfolder to provide more details to both students and teachers who may be using this work. 

FOR STUDENTS IN MY GEOS 113: If you are a student taking this class with me at EWU, this course prep mirrors the course Canvas page you should automatically have access to upon registration and enrollment in the course. You can find all the same course materials in the same file/folder structure as the course here on GitHub. Please remember that if you are taking this class in person, then the labs are in person as well -- be sure to follow instructions in class for where to go each week and for each class session!

I genuinely welcome feedback so if you find something missing, incorrect, or broken in this repository, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at lstachowiak@ewu.edu! 

Live long and prosper,
Lauren
