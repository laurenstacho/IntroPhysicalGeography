# Lectures

This folder contains the weekly lecture slides for the term. Each file is labeled based on the week in the term it is delivered. The weekly lectures also match to the weekly labs (found in the Labs folder). 

As a reminder, the textbook is optional for this course but if you choose to purchase one, they can be found via online retailers/book renters.

Textbook specs: Elemental Geosystems by Birkeland, 8th Edition. Alternative edtions should also work, the page numbers just may be slightly different for the chapters.
